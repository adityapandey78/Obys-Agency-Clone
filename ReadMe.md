# Obys Agency Clone

Obys Agency is atech agency which is expert in creating beautiful mordern website based in Ukraine.  

## Overwiew

My Aim was to make a project arond Javascript utilising its animation libraries.  
It was a very great project to deep dive into CSS and Javascript and comibing both to make  compelling effects


## Libraries Used  
1.[Locomotive Scroll](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/locomotive-scroll) : A Js library used for smooth scrolling and animating text based on the scroll position.  
2.[GSAP](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap) : A Js  library used for animation  
3.[GSAP-ScrollTrigger](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/ScrollTrigger.min.js) : A Js library used in GSAP for smooth scrooling  
4.[sheryjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sheryjs) : A Js library created by sheriyans Coding School.

## Learnings:  
- Used the above libraries to implement  various complex animations  
- Used SheryJs for the `woobling effect`  and other `cursor magnet`   
- Used Locomotive Scroll to implement the animation section of `About-Obys` section  
- Used CSS Animation for the `horizontal animation` and `Let's create`
- Used Js to implement the `loading page` and `Counter`  
- It  was really very good project on learning perspective.  
- ⚠️ Making it resposnive soon :)
